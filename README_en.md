**TL;DR**: designs and **deployable code** for aggregating the data that IoT devices produce at a
factory or site into one place, analysing it with Kafka and ClickHouse, and connecting it to AWS AI
services. FSx for ONTAP is the storage layer in the worked example; the differences when using S3 or
EFS are stated alongside it.

## What is here

Three maturity levels per row. **Implemented** means deployable code exists in this repository.
**Design only** means the design is written but there is no code. **Concept** means an outline only.

maturity label and a note on when to choose it. What has and has not been verified on hardware is
collected under [About this repository](#about-this-repository).

## Architecture

![Files written by cameras and vibration sensors at an edge site are aggregated through local storage into Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, and reach Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Athena and Amazon SageMaker AI through an S3 access point. Amazon Quick Sight follows Athena, and on the on-premises side the vibration sensor's events pass through Kafka and ClickHouse to dashboards](docs/images/architecture-file-path-en.svg)

Figure 1: the file path — written over NFS, read through an S3 access point ([.drawio](docs/diagrams/architecture-file-path-en.drawio) / [日本語](docs/images/architecture-file-path.svg))

![The MQTT path through AWS IoT Core and AWS Lambda puts objects through an S3 access point and lands them in Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. The cellular path goes from the SORACOM platform through Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon Data Firehose into a standard S3 bucket, which AWS Glue reads](docs/images/architecture-api-paths-en.svg)

Figure 2: the two paths that write over the S3 API — MQTT and cellular ([.drawio](docs/diagrams/architecture-api-paths-en.drawio) / [日本語](docs/images/architecture-api-paths.svg))

**There are two figures because writes arrive from two directions.** In one figure the
thirteen cloud nodes sit in a single row, and scaled into a reader's column their labels
arrive at the equivalent of 8px.

**Data paths:**
- **Payload** (images, CSV, logs): edge → NFS → ONTAP (source of truth)
- **Events** (metadata): edge → Kafka → ClickHouse (analytics)
- **AI analysis**: ONTAP → S3 AP → Bedrock / Lambda (quality verdict)
- **MQTT**: AWS IoT Core → Lambda → **PutObject through the S3 AP** (no standard bucket)
- **Cellular (optional)**: SORACOM → Kinesis → Firehose → **standard S3 bucket** → Glue
- **Backup**: ClickHouse → ONTAP S3 (S3-compatible storage)

Writes arrive from two directions. The edge writes over a file protocol and the data is
read through the S3 AP; separately, `cloud/iot_ingestion/` writes over the S3 API and keeps
ONTAP as the source of truth. The second shape is the one
[S3 Burst on ONTAP Files](https://github.com/Yoshiki0705/s3-burst-on-ontap-files)
covers, and it suits pipelines that begin at a cloud API.

A standard S3 bucket remains on the cellular path only, for two reasons: Amazon Data
Firehose takes an S3 bucket ARN as its destination (whether it accepts an access point is
unverified), and Amazon Athena's query results location is officially required to be an S3
bucket. See [S3 AP compatibility and limits](docs/en/s3ap-compatibility-matrix.md).

**Constraints a figure cannot draw:** a figure shows paths, and the six below do not take the
shape of a line. They used to sit in a notes box inside the figure, but a box's longest line
fixed the figure's width, and a wider figure is scaled down further in a reader's column — so
the annotation was taking legibility from every other label to buy its own.

| Constraint | What it says | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| S3 access point prerequisites | ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, same Region, same account, and a mounted volume | [Prerequisites and structural constraints](docs/en/s3ap-compatibility-matrix.md#2-prerequisites-and-structural-constraints) |
| Authorization is two layers | A request has to pass both IAM and file system permissions | [Authorization is evaluated in two layers](docs/en/s3ap-compatibility-matrix.md#authorization-is-evaluated-in-two-layers) |
| Where a standard S3 bucket is required | Athena's query results location is officially an S3 bucket. Firehose also takes an S3 bucket ARN, and whether it accepts an access point is unverified | [Services that require an S3 bucket name](docs/en/s3ap-compatibility-matrix.md#4-services-that-require-an-s3-bucket-name) |
| Amazon SageMaker AI has no walkthrough | Official walkthroughs via an access point exist for Athena, AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, Bedrock Knowledge Bases, EMR Serverless, CloudFront and Transfer Family | [AWS services usable through an S3 access point](docs/en/s3ap-compatibility-matrix.md#1-aws-services-usable-through-an-s3-access-point) |
| The cellular path is optional | The IAM role is created only when `SoracomOperatorId` is supplied. SORACOM's own account assumes it with that value as the `ExternalId` and writes to Kinesis and to `raw/` in the bucket | [Deployment guide](docs/en/deployment-guide.md) |
| Hardware testing incomplete | The edge side and the ONTAP integration are unverified | [Verification status](docs/en/verification-status.md) |

## The problem

Factories and sites generate data continuously from IoT devices — cameras, sensors, control PCs.
In most cases that data ends up scattered per device and per site.

**What this looks like:**
- Camera images in the printer vendor's cloud, sensor data on the Pi's SD card, equipment logs on a Windows PC
- No way to analyse data from site A alongside site B
- Individual device data is visible, but the whole picture — correlation, trends — is not
- Analysis with AI is wanted, but the data is scattered and no pipeline can be built

On the edge and on-premises side:
- The platform and tooling for cross-cutting analysis are not in place
- Governance, cataloguing and access control have to be built from nothing
- Building the analytics platform itself costs enough time and money that data work never starts

## Approach

A hybrid pipeline: aggregate scattered IoT data into a storage layer, analyse with Kafka and
ClickHouse, and run image analysis on AWS AI services.

**Data flow:**
1. Edge devices write to storage over NFS (payload: images, CSV)
2. In parallel, they publish a structured event to Kafka (metadata: when, where, what)
3. ClickHouse ingests from Kafka and serves dashboards and anomaly detection
4. Amazon Bedrock (via Lambda) analyses images and returns a quality verdict
5. Databricks manages curated datasets and produces AI training data

**Before → After:**

| | Before | After |
|---|--------|-------|
| Data | Siloed per device | Aggregated, distributed over Kafka |
| Analysis | No means (tooling has to be built first) | Dashboards in ClickHouse |
| Anomaly detection | Human inspection (impossible unattended) | AI detects and alerts (target: within 60 seconds of capture; not measured on hardware) |
| Cross-site analysis | Impossible | Quality trends across sites in Databricks |

### Who this is for

- **IoT / edge developers** looking for how to aggregate and use the data devices produce
- **Data practitioners** wanting to break device-level silos and analyse across an organisation
- **Existing ONTAP users** wanting to use ONTAP as the aggregation point for IoT data
- **AWS users** wanting to use Athena, Bedrock or SageMaker against a source other than S3

### Storage layer options

The core pattern — edge collection, aggregation, AI analysis — holds with a different aggregation
point.

| Storage | Data flow | Characteristics | Constraints |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **S3 directly** | Edge → S3 → Athena/Bedrock | Simplest. Easy setup. Native AWS integration. S3 Object Lock for tamper protection. Edge caching via CloudFront | No NFS/SMB access. Integrating with existing file workflows takes extra work. Event-driven via S3 Event Notifications |
| **EFS** | Edge → NFS → EFS → Lambda/Bedrock | NFS mountable. Good fit for Linux devices. Auto-scaling. Protected by AWS Backup | No SMB. No direct S3 API access. Event-driven has to be built with Lambda + CloudWatch. Cross-Region via EFS Replication |
| **ONTAP** | Edge → NFS/SMB → ONTAP → S3 AP → AWS AI | NFS, SMB and S3 over the same data. FPolicy for file-arrival triggers. SnapMirror for differential sync. FlexCache for low-latency delivery to remote sites. ARP/AI for ransomware anomaly detection with automatic Snapshot protection | Requires an ONTAP environment. S3 AP does not support conditional writes, and [has other constraints](docs/en/s3ap-compatibility-matrix.md). Operating it requires ONTAP knowledge |

**How to choose:**
- No data yet, building fresh → **S3 directly** is simplest
- Writing over NFS from Linux devices, staying inside a VPC → **EFS**
- Data already on ONTAP/NAS, both NFS and SMB needed, avoiding a copy → **ONTAP**

### Edge devices (options)

| Device | Connection | Use |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Wired LAN (NFS) | Camera capture, sensor collection, edge inference |
| USB camera (4K) | Via Pi | Visual inspection, quality monitoring |
| CSI camera (NoIR V2) | Via Pi | Low-light and near-infrared capture |
| 3D printer | Wired LAN (SMB) | Print data storage |
| SORACOM S+ Camera | Cellular (option) | Sites without wired LAN |
| SORACOM Air + Pi | Cellular (option) | Connectivity for sites without wired LAN |
| Industrial sensors | Pi GPIO / I2C / SPI | Temperature, humidity, vibration, current |

### ONTAP platforms (options)

| Platform | Placement | Characteristics |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| FAS/AFF | On-premises | Hardware appliance |
| ONTAP Select | On-premises / VM | Software-defined, runs on general-purpose servers or VMs |
| FSx for ONTAP | AWS cloud | Fully managed. SnapMirror destination, supports S3 AP (ONTAP 9.17.1 or later) |

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

## About this repository

### Current limits

- **Hardware testing incomplete**: the edge devices (Raspberry Pi, cameras) have not arrived, so
  no end-to-end test on hardware has run. The only thing measured on real AWS is the two-stage
  Amazon Bedrock analysis, and there is no record of a SAM template ever being deployed. The status
  of each stage is in [verification status](docs/en/verification-status.md)
- **AI accuracy comes from two different tests**: 4/4 on four photographs published in vendor
  documentation, and 5/5 on five written descriptions of symptoms. Synthetic images generated with
  OpenCV were a separate round and were correctly identified as not photographic. **The two measure
  different things and are not additive.** Accuracy under real conditions — lighting, camera angle,
  filament colour — is unverified
- **ONTAP integration is design only**: the FPolicy, SnapMirror and S3 AP code is written, but has
  not run against a real ONTAP system (mock tests only)
- **Single device**: concurrent operation of multiple devices and scale-out are unverified
- **Kafka / ClickHouse pending**: awaiting a managed platform deployment. The path is exercised
  through [`local-demo/`](local-demo/) in the meantime

### What has been learned so far

- **Two-stage AI analysis can lower cost (calculated)**: analysing every image with the
  screen with a cheap model and escalate only suspected anomalies. **How much it saves is decided
  by the anomaly rate** and narrows as that rate rises; at a 100% anomaly rate two stages cost
  more than one. No monthly figure here: the $259 and $40 that used to be quoted came from unit
  prices with different, unrecorded sources and could not be reproduced, so they were withdrawn.
  The formula and the current rates are in the [cost model](docs/en/cost-model.md). The pattern applies
  to other AI pipelines
- **Prompting alone reaches usable accuracy for industrial image checks**: 4 of 4 on photographs
  from vendor documentation with Claude Vision prompts and no custom model training. Verification
  under real
  conditions is still ahead
- **FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points carry constraints**: no conditional writes and no event
  notifications, so Iceberg and Delta Lake cannot be written directly and FPolicy has to fill the
  gap. The full list, with the basis for each item, is in
  [S3 AP compatibility and constraints](docs/en/s3ap-compatibility-matrix.md)
- **The ONTAP REST API is usable for IoT telemetry**: performance metrics, capacity and health at
  one-minute intervals. Polling-based, but sufficient for a proof of concept

### Why this exists

Visiting sites as an SA/SE, one comment kept recurring: data from IoT devices and sensors sits
separately per site and per device, and cannot be analysed across them. The data is being produced;
the silos are what prevent using it. On the on-premises side there was also no analytics platform or
governance tooling in place, so "we would have to build the tools first" became the reason nothing
started.

Three things arriving together made "aggregate, then analyse across" cheap enough to attempt:

- **FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points**: S3 API access to aggregated data without a copy
- **Multimodal AI maturity**: general-purpose prompts reaching usable accuracy on industrial images
- **Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB)**: enough capacity for preprocessing and light inference at the edge

**3D print quality monitoring** was chosen as the first subject: visually legible, and failures
happen often enough to gather test data.
